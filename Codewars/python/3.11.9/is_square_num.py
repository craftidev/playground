A square of squares

You like building blocks.
You especially like building blocks that are squares.
And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square.
Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things!
If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain…
Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task:
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
    In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer;
    in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples:
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
